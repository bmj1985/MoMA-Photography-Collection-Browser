## Problem Statement
* The Museum of Modern Art has been instrumental in the history of photography, and has one of the most extensive photography collections in the world. Although their own website is searchable and even sortable by year, it does not give easily to browsing and discovery.
* This site was created in the hopes of making photography and photographers in the museum's collection easier to discover.
